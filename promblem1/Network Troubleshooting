Network Troubleshooting 

1. Ping outside domains and ip's looked good
2. Looked up resolve.conf for DNS servers 
3. Ran dig on each server. Recieved no response from 10.0.0.186 but recursion is not allowed. Most likely used as DNS caching server
DNS resolved for 10.0.0.150
4. Traceroute ran to ubuntu.com showing some dropped hops cannot traceroute -I or 
5. mtr ubuntu.com, etc Showing no serious packet loss.
