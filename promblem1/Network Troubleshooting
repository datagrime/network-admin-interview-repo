Network Torubleshooting Steps 

1. Ping outside domains and IP's. Everything looked good. 

2. Looked up nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf. Two name servers listed. 

3. Ran dig @ each nameserver. Received no response from 10.0.0.186 but recursion is not allowed. Most likely used as DNS caching server. 
DNS resolved for 10.0.0.150. Would maybe investigate server 10.0.0.186 to see if it is configured correctly.

4. Traceroute -I to various domains showing some missed hops but resolving. 

5. Test packet loss by running mtr to various domains. No serious packet loss was reported.

6. Checked /etc/services.conf to make sure no applicable ports were disabled. 

Overall the client seems to be working to the best of my knowledge. Usually, intermittent network issues are DNS or bandwidth related. 
To troubelshoot further I would check the DNS servers for any issues and the firewall appliance for any insight on bandwidth usage.
