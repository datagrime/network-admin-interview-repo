Network Torubleshooting

1. Ping outside domains and IP's looked good
2. Looked up resolve.conf for DNS servers 
3. Ran dig @ each server. Received no response from 10.0.0.186 but recursion is not allowed. Most likely used as DNS caching server
DNS resolved for 10.0.0.150. Would maybe investigate server 10.0.0.186 to see if it is configured correctly. 
4. Traceroute -I ran to ubuntu.com some missed hops but resolving. 
5. ran mtr on ubuntu.com, google.com etc... Showing no serious packet loss.

Overall the client seems to be working to the best of my knowledge. Usually, intermittent network issues are DNS or bandwidth related.
To troubelshoot further I would check the DNS servers for any issues and the firewall for any insight on bandwidth usage.
